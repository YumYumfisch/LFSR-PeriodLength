# LFSR-PeriodLength

This is a tool to visualize the mechanics of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR).\
It calculates period lengths for various taps and starting values and provides taps to generate a sequence with the longest possible period for a given register count.

Tables visualizing the period lengths of LFSRs with different register counts in relation to the chosen tap and starting value can be found in [this folder](./tables/).
